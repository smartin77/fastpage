# FastPage - A simple templated PHP website

## Introduction
This project is based on PHP and FT library made by Cornel Alexa (Fast Template replacement).
Content is stored only as text files and layout templates.
There's no need to use database. All the content is stored as text files.
Content files and templates can be translated (see known issues).

Project also support simple "Contact Us" send form via mail with translated status messages and very simple validation.

Project is suited for the very simple applications and requires basic knowledge of PHP.

## Known issues
- content file names are not translated, also theirs URI repesentation (reduces SEO)

## History
This project comes from early version of my own CMS system. Later I used to use it for very simple demo pages and templates. Recently I update some parts of code to share on github.
